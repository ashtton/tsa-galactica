    <p class="subtitle">All our launches are held at either Florida or California. All passengers will be required
    to wear a pressure suit for launch. Our rocket ships are unlike the traditional ship, they stay in one piece through
    the atmosphere. This allows our ships to autonomously land back at the launch site when coming back to Earth.</p>
